# Impression：

伦敦博物馆有非常好的“感”，从建筑外来看，它以极强的构成设计感建立在公园中，很特别却又与社区和路人加强了亲和感。从建筑内来看，具有构成感的穹顶架构以及木质地板的装潢，与从建筑外形成了自然的联系。空间营造出的开阔沉静，让这里有种下沉剧场的感觉。紧凑的展品处于简洁的展馆设计中，也让我更关注展品本身。主题展“Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design”、“WEIRD SENSATION FEELS GOOD: The World of ASMR”、“Yinka Ilori: PARABLES FOR HAPPINESS”还有永久收藏的现代设计，让我了解设计的功能、体验、文化、历史、女权、艺术、边界。

这不是一个“普通”的博物馆，它比“普通”的博物馆更具思辨性，其展览的正是世界的过去、现在和未来，也展示出了生活在不同时代背景的设计师，对事物和社会事件的具有趣味性、未来性和批判性的探索。如：女性可以通过设计作品更诗意的表达自己的身体、突破理性的设计、为未来人口过剩设计的觅食者。

The Museum of London has a very good "sense". From the outside of the building, it is established in the park with a strong sense of composition design, which is very special but strengthens the affinity with the community and passers-by. From the inside, the structural dome structure and the wooden flooring form a natural connection with the outside. The space is open and quiet, giving it the feeling of a sinking theater. The compact exhibits in the concise pavilion design also made me pay more attention to the exhibits themselves. Theme exhibitions "Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design", "WEIRD SENSATION FEELS GOOD: The World of ASMR", "Yinka Ilori: PARABLES FOR HAPPINESS "and the permanent collection of modern design, let me understand the function of design, experience, culture, history, women's rights, art, boundaries.

This is not an "ordinary" museum, it is more speculative than an "ordinary" museum, its exhibition is exactly the past, present and future of the world, but also shows designers living in different time backgrounds, interesting, future and critical exploration of things and social events. For example, women can express their bodies more poetical through design works, break through rational design, and design foragers for future overpopulation.

# Analyze the exhibition:

“Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design”反映着中产阶级在使用超现实主义的方式，激进、艰苦、梦一般的在追求内在需求。这种定义是我来自展览的主题概述、展品解释、视觉系统、作品视觉理解出来的，从走进展览到结束是以时间线的叙述结构进行阐述的，这规范了观众在大部分的情况下以逻辑更顺畅的线性结构跟随展览理解下去。策展的话语权规范着知识的传播，也垄断着当下的相关知识，就像超现实主义早期把“爱欲”当作受禁忌的现实巅峰，但Meret Oppenheim创作且引起轰动的充满情色与欢乐的毛茸杯却并没能展出。勒·柯布西耶为千万富翁的收藏家Don Carlos de Beistegui设计高规格屋顶露台，公寓也被设计成豪华私人场所，那超现实主义为富人设计出了梦一般的房子，而展览为什么没展出它为其他阶级？为什么空间设计使得展品之间缺乏紧密联系？超现实主义运动它的背景又是什么呢？

打破展览的叙述结构和加强该展览的历史知识和陈述性知识，可以适应线上展览社区进行实时共享信息，所有正在观展的人可以扫展览二维码加入展览社区，人们可以在这里公共讨论有关“超现实主义”的感想或补充知识，也可以阅读超现实主义运动和相关展品的完整历史和推荐相关作品以及书籍。规范和加强空间与展品之间的联系。

"Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design" reflects the middle class's use of surrealism, radical, hard and dreamlike pursuit of inner needs. This definition is derived from the theme overview, exhibit explanation, visual system and visual understanding of the works of the exhibition. From the entry to the exhibition to the end, it is elaborated in the narrative structure of the time line, which rules the audience to follow and understand the exhibition in a more logical and linear structure in most cases. The discourse power of curation regulates the dissemination of knowledge and monopolizes the current knowledge. For example, in the early surrealism, "eros" is regarded as the peak of the taboo reality. However, the hairy cup full of eroticism and joy created by Meret Oppenheim, which caused a sensation, was not exhibited. Le Corbusier designed high-spec roof terraces for multimillionaire collector Don Carlos de Beistegui, and apartments were designed as luxurious private places, so surrealism designed dreamlike houses for the rich, but why didn't the exhibition show it for other classes? Why does the space design make the exhibits lack a close connection? What is the background of the Surrealist movement?

By breaking the narrative structure of the exhibition and strengthening the historical and declarative knowledge of the exhibition, it can adapt to the online exhibition community to share information in real time. All the visitors can join the exhibition community by scanning the two-dimensional code of the exhibition, where people can publicly discuss their feelings about "surrealism" or add knowledge. You can also read a complete history of the Surrealist movement and related exhibits and recommended works and books. Standardize and strengthen the connection between space and exhibits.

# Create my own exhibition:

· 我将设计一个展览叫做“全”。因为我在观看在设计博物馆现代主义设计展览区中有着大量优秀的且理性的工业设计产品，如：苹果公司电子产品、打字机、AK47枪械，但有关残疾人或边缘人群的关怀设计却少之又少。

· 展览主要以衣、食、住、行的方式进行叙述，展品主要包括、临床、战后、残疾人、感官障碍者、歧视、适老化等已“补全”目标人群缺失或未来思辨型的设计。如：脚用鼠标、视障人士导盲鞋、狱后工作VR面试模拟等。每一件展品都会有设计背景、设计思路、使用者视频反馈。

· 空间上关怀设计理论、设计思路、视觉系统，以及展品要以类别的形式紧凑地展出。关怀设计类展品的选出可以与设计类高校、残障人士等机构合作，通过小范围的投票或推荐来选出，最终可以由策展方进行讨论决定。

策展中固有的动力机制取决于策展方对某个主题展的理解以及话语的分量。展览的空间以及动线是否清晰、视觉系统归纳的是否完整、展品是否有关主题或是否具有代表性、展览背景以及展品说明是否阐述的明白，观众、设计师、艺术家、策展机构是否都能参与展览之中，这些都会影响策展知识结构的塑造。

· I will design an exhibition called "Quan". Because I was looking at a large number of excellent and rational industrial design products in the Modernist design exhibition area of the Design Museum, such as Apple electronics, typewriters, AK47 guns, but there were very few caring designs about the disabled or marginalized people.

· The exhibition is mainly narrated in the ways of clothing, food, housing and walking. The exhibits mainly include the designs that have "completed" the missing or future-thinking of the target population, such as clinical, postwar, disabled, sensory disabled, discrimination and aging. Such as: foot mouse, guide shoes for the visually impaired, after prison work VR interview simulation. Each exhibit will have a design background, design ideas and video feedback from users.

· Spatially concerned design theories, design ideas, visual systems, and exhibits should be displayed in a compact form of categories. Caring design exhibits can be selected in cooperation with design universities, people with disabilities and other institutions, through a small range of voting or recommendation, and finally can be discussed and decided by the curator.

The inherent dynamic mechanism of curation depends on the curators' understanding of a certain theme and the weight of the discourse. Whether the exhibition space and the movement line are clear, whether the visual system is complete, whether the exhibits are related to the theme or representative, whether the exhibition background and the exposition of the exhibits are clear, whether the audience, designers, artists and curators can participate in the exhibition, all these will affect the shaping of the curatorial knowledge structure.

# Reflect (back) on my new exhibition:

1. 增加一些可以让观众体验关残疾人或边缘人群日常生活的东西，例如：视障人士体验，模拟残障人士行为，或生活中遭遇不公的视角。
2. 增加可体验式的关怀设计展品，让观众深入感受设计。
3. 增加设计师、艺术家与观众的讨论环节。
4. 增加更多的策展机构。

加入更多让观众的体验，可以更好的让观众了解关怀设计；加入作者与观众的讨论环节，增加展览的历史、陈述等知识和打破策展者私人的叙述意愿；加入更多的策展机构，打破策展机构的权威。上述方式的目的是让权力重新分配，权力也向观众、艺术家、设计师等倾斜。让策展的参与方更多元也会让展览的知识结构更丰富。

1. Add something that allows the audience to experience the daily life of the disabled or marginalized people, such as the experience of the visually impaired, the simulation of the behavior of the disabled, or the perspective of injustice in life.
2. Increase experiential caring design exhibits, so that the audience can feel the design deeply.
3. Increase discussions between designers, artists and audiences.
4. Add more curatorial institutions.

By adding more experiences for the audience, the audience can better understand the caring design; Join the discussion between the author and the audience, increase the knowledge of the exhibition history and statement, and break the curator's personal narrative will; Join more curatorial institutions and break the authority of curatorial institutions. The goal is to redistribute power in favor of the audience, artists, designers, etc. A more diverse group of curators will also enrich the knowledge structure of the exhibition.

# Critique the Design museum and the exhibition
回顾原来的展览我不同意原策展人的决定，部分展品的选择也让我看到超现实主义的作品是非常激进和非凡的，但不是全部。虽然整体是由时间线叙述的，策展人使用空间的权力让展品之间混乱的排列，这也会让观众困惑。策展方没有提供充足的文化、历史背景知识，策展方仿佛假设观众对超现实主义已经熟悉，这使观众面对阐述过于简单的超现实主义运动和作品，无法深度理解内容。

策展人遗漏了观众的权力，应该加强观众的权力动态，在展览中观众属于一种被边缘化的群体，让这些群体的思想在展览中获得更大的认可度，可以让人们重新审视自己的观点。缺乏更多元的知识结构，可以选择讲解或实时线上展览社区启发观众思考。可以让观众学习如何用超现实主义思维进行简单的思辨创作，增加互动以及对知识的掌握程度。

Looking back on the original exhibition, I disagree with the decision of the original curator. The selection of some exhibits also makes me see that the surrealist works are very radical and extraordinary, but not all of them. Although the whole is narrated by the timeline, the curators use the power of space to make a chaotic arrangement between the exhibits, which can also confuse the audience. The curators did not provide sufficient cultural and historical background knowledge. It seems that the curators assumed that the audience was already familiar with surrealism, which made the audience unable to deeply understand the surrealism movement and works with too simple exposition.

The curator has omitted the power of the audience, so the power dynamic of the audience should be strengthened. In the exhibition, the audience belongs to a marginalized group, so that the thoughts of these groups can gain greater recognition in the exhibition, so that people can re-examine their own views. Lack of more diversified knowledge structure, can choose to explain or real-time online exhibition community to inspire the audience to think. It allows the audience to learn how to make simple speculative creation with surrealistic thinking, and increases interaction and knowledge mastery.
